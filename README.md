# Music Categorization Tool

This repository contains a music categorization tool that utilizes the `music_genre.csv` dataset for training and evaluation. The tool applies various machine learning algorithms to process the data and classify music into different genres.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `music_genre.csv`. It contains a collection of music samples with corresponding genre labels. Each sample is represented by a set of features, such as tempo, energy, and danceability, which are used to train the machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The music categorization tool employs several machine learning algorithms to process the dataset and classify the music samples. The following algorithms are implemented and evaluated:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Liner Regresion
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. ANN


## Results

The categorization tool generates evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, for each machine learning algorithm. These metrics provide insights into the performance of each algorithm in classifying the music samples into their respective genres.
